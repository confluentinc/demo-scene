== Introduction

KSQL is the powerful SQL Streaming engine for Apache Kafka. Using standard SQL statements you can build powerful stream processing applications. In this article we'll see how to troubleshoot some of the common issues that people encounter with KSQL. More advanced topics such as digging deeper into the internals for more advanced troubleshooting will be covered by a subsequent article. 

You can use this article for reference, or you can follow along with the code examples to try them out as we go. Using Docker and Docker Compose, we can easily provision an environment in which to explore and try out the different techniques and tools. The environment includes a data generator for a continuous stream of events into a Kafka topic that we will use for testing. You'll find all the necessary code on https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/blob/ksql-troubleshooting/ksql-troubleshooting/[GitHub].

So now let's dive in and start exploring what to do when things aren't working…

== Why's my KSQL query not returning data? 

Probably the most common question in the http://cnfl.io/slack[Confluent Community Slack group]'s #ksql channel is: 

[quote]
Why is my KSQL query not returning data?

That is, you've run a `CREATE STREAM`, but when you go to query it…

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT * FROM MY_FIRST_KSQL_STREAM;
----

…nothing happens. And because KSQL queries are _continuous_, your KSQL session appears to "hang". That's because KSQL's continuing to wait for any new messages to show you. So if your run a KSQL `SELECT` and get no results back, what could be the reasons for that? 

The answer usually comes down to one of four main reasons (the first three of which are variations on a theme): 

1. No data in the source topic
2. No new data arriving in the topic
3. KSQL consuming from a later offset than for which there is data
4. Deserialization errors in reading the data

Let's look at each of these in turn and how to diagnose them. 

=== No data in the source topic

Let's work this through from the start. We believe we've got data in a topic called `ratingz`, so we register it with KSQL as a `STREAM`: 

[source,sql]
----
ksql> CREATE STREAM RATINGS (rating_id BIGINT, \
                             user_id BIGINT, \
                             stars INT, \
                             route_id BIGINT, \
                             rating_time BIGINT, \
                             channel VARCHAR, \
                             message varchar) \
        WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='ratingz', \
        VALUE_FORMAT='JSON');

 Message
----------------
 Stream created
----------------
ksql>
----

And then, we query the new stream: 

[source,sql]
----
SELECT rating_id, user_id, message FROM RATINGS;
----

++++
<script src="https://asciinema.org/a/201664.js" id="asciicast-201664" async></script>
++++
//https://asciinema.org/a/201664

No data comes back—so let's now do some detective work. 

The first thing is to confirm which Kafka topic we're using to drive the stream. We _think_ we know (we just ran the `CREATE STREAM`, right?), but as with any good troubleshooting approach the key is methodically working through the possibilities.

So using the `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` command we can verify the topic from which the stream is sourced: 

[source,sql,numbered]
----
ksql> DESCRIBE EXTENDED RATINGS;

Name                 : RATINGS
Type                 : STREAM
Key field            :
Key format           : STRING
Timestamp field      : Not set - using <ROWTIME>
Value format         : JSON
Kafka topic          : ratingz (partitions: 1, replication: 1) // <1>
[...]
----
<1> The Kafka topic used by this stream

So our source topic is `ratingz`. Now we will step away from KSQL and use another Kafka consumer to verify if there is data in the topic. My preferred tool here is https://docs.confluent.io/current/app-development/kafkacat-usage.html[`kafkacat`] but you can use other tools, such as `kafka-console-consumer`, if you like. Invoking kafkacat shows: 

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --network ksql-troubleshooting_default --tty --interactive --rm \
          confluentinc/cp-kafkacat \
          kafkacat -b kafka:29092 \
          -C -t ratingz \
          -o beginning
% Reached end of topic ratingz [0] at offset 0
----

The `-o beginning` tells it to go back to the beginning of the topic, and `-C` to read the messages. `Reached end of topic` shows that there's no data to read. No data means that KSQL isn't going to be showing anything in the output of a `SELECT`! 

NOTE: => So in this case, there's no data in the source topic. Turns out we mistook the topic name, and used `ratingz` instead of `ratings`! D'oh! 

=== No new data arriving in the topic

Let's fix our stream, and use the `ratings` topic (with an `s` this time). Register it with KSQL, dropping the previous version first: 

[source,sql]
----
ksql> DROP STREAM RATINGS;

 Message
------------------------------
 Source RATINGS was dropped.
------------------------------
ksql> CREATE STREAM RATINGS (rating_id BIGINT, user_id BIGINT, stars INT, route_id BIGINT, rating_time BIGINT, channel VARCHAR, message varchar) WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='ratings', VALUE_FORMAT='JSON');

 Message
----------------
 Stream created
----------------
ksql>
----

As before, try to query the stream, and find there's no data being returned:  

[source,sql]
----
SELECT rating_id, user_id, message FROM RATINGS;

[ no output returned from KSQL ]

----

Let's do as before, and first verify the source topic for the stream that we're querying: 

[source,sql]
----
ksql> DESCRIBE EXTENDED RATINGS;
[...]
Kafka topic          : ratings (partitions: 1, replication: 1)
----

and use `kafkacat` to check if there's any data in it: 

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --network ksql-troubleshooting_default --tty --interactive --rm \
          confluentinc/cp-kafkacat \
          kafkacat -b kafka:29092 \
          -C -t ratings \
          -o beginning
{"rating_id":1,"user_id":2,"stars":1,"route_id":2350,"rating_time":1537182554356,"channel":"web","message":"thank you for the most friendly, helpful experience today at your new lounge"}
{"rating_id":2,"user_id":10,"stars":3,"route_id":4161,"rating_time":1537182555220,"channel":"web","message":"more peanuts please"}
[...]
----

Turns out there's thousands of messages in the topic! But, by default, KSQL reads from the end of a topic, and no *new* messages were being written the topic. As soon as new messages were sent to it, the `SELECT` returns results

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT rating_id, user_id, message FROM RATINGS;
1 | 8 | (expletive deleted)
2 | 19 | more peanuts please
3 | 8 | meh
[...]
----

++++
<script src="https://asciinema.org/a/qDKaSYgu1ssP71nkkykAPlThl.js" id="asciicast-qDKaSYgu1ssP71nkkykAPlThl" async></script>
++++
// https://asciinema.org/a/201667

NOTE: => So here we just needed to feed the topic more data. What about if you want to look at data already in the topic? That's what we'll look at in the next section. 

=== KSQL consuming from a later offset than for which there is data

Kafka is an immutable log of events, and data is persisted according to the retention settings. When an application reads data from a Kafka topic, the data remains in place, but the _offset_ in the log at which that particular application has read up to is recorded. Another application can read the same data from the same topic, completely independently from the first. The main thing is that there is a log of data, and consuming applications choose the point on the log at which they want to read. 

When KSQL reads data from a topic, it will default to read from the _latest offset_—that is to say, only new messages arriving in the topic _after_ the topic is registered in KSQL. 

You can verify the offset setting using `LIST PROPERTIES`: 

[source,sql]
----
ksql> LIST PROPERTIES;

 Property                                               | Value
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
 ksql.streams.auto.offset.reset                         | latest
[...]
----

Often—and particularly in testing and development—you'll want to read the data that _already exists in a topic_. To tell KSQL to do this, you change the offset property: 

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset'='earliest';
Successfully changed local property 'auto.offset.reset' from 'null' to 'earliest'
ksql>
----

Now when you run a `SELECT`, KSQL will return the data from the beginning of the topic. The `SELECT` will still run continuously, so if there is new data arriving you'll see that—and if there isn't the `SELECT` will just hang and wait for new data (or for you to cancel the query).

++++


=== Deserialization errors in reading the data

Data in Kafka is just bytes. It's up to the producer how it serialises the source message, and the consumer (which is KSQL here) needs to deserialise using the same method. Common serialisation formats include Avro, JSON, etc.

If KSQL cannot deserialise message data, it will not write anything to the `SELECT` results. If this happens, you could have checked the three situations above and ruled them out—but still not have any data returned to your `SELECT`. 

Here's a simple example, using one of the existing internal topics called `_confluent-metrics`. Let's register it using a fictional schema that we believe to be correct for the purposes of this example, and declare the serialisation format of the message values to be JSON (tip: it's not JSON!): 

[source,sql]
----
CREATE STREAM METRICS (col1 int, col2 int, col3 varchar) \
  WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='_confluent-metrics', VALUE_FORMAT='JSON');
----

Taking the lesson from above, set the offset to earliest so that we definitely will pull all the messages, and run a `SELECT`: 

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset'='earliest';
Successfully changed local property 'auto.offset.reset' from 'earliest' to 'earliest'
ksql> SELECT * FROM METRICS;

----

So…no results coming back. Let's go through the checklist (although we can check off the offset already, as we've specifically set that): 

1. What topic are we querying? 
+
[source,sql]
----
ksql> DESCRIBE EXTENDED METRICS;
[...]
Kafka topic          : _confluent-metrics (partitions: 12, replication: 1)
----

2. Is there any data in it? 
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --network ksql-troubleshooting_default --tty --interactive --rm \
          confluentinc/cp-kafkacat \
          kafkacat -b kafka:29092 \
          -C -t _confluent-metrics \
          -o beginning -c 1 <1>
                                                                                                                                            ���,�

        kafka.logSizeLog"$partition.9.topic.__consumer_offsets*Akafka.log:type=Log,name=Size,topic=__consumer_offsets,partition=90�

        kafka.logSizeLog"$partition.8.topic.__consumer_offsets*Akafka.log:type=Log,name=Size,topic=__consumer_offsets,partition=80�

        kafka.logSizeLog"$partition.7.topic.__consumer_offsets*Akafka.log:type=Log,name=Size,topic=__consumer_offsets,partition=70�

        kafka.logSizeLog"$partition.6.topic.__consumer_offsets*Akafka.log:type=Log,name=Size,topic=__consumer_offsets,partition=60�
        [...]
----
<1>  The `-c 1` argument tells `kafkacat` to just return the one message and then exit

So, there is data, we're querying the correct topic, we've set the offset back to the begining…why isn't KSQL returning data? 

Well, the data we can see from the output of `kafkacat` clearly isn't JSON, which is what we declared in the `CREATE STREAM` command. If we go to the KSQL server log file, you'll see a whole bunch of these deserialisation errors: 

[source,bash]
----

You can see from the stack track it's using the JSON deserialiser (as you'd expect, given our `VALUE_FORMAT` configuration), and you can also see from the sample message in the log output that it's shown (`[Source: (byte[])�����,� �`) that it clearly isn't JSON. 

If you hit this problem, then you need to synchronise your serialisation and deserialisation formats. KSQL supports delimited (CSV), JSON, or Avro. If you're using Protobuf then check out https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/1472[KLIP-0] which proposes adding this to KSQL. 

==== Not all of the messages from my topic are shown in KSQL

Following on from the above example of _no_ messages being returned, you may also see cases where only _some_ of the messages are shown, and it could be the same root cause—serialisation—but with a different slant. Instead of simply getting your serialisation format _wrong_, maybe you chose the right serialisation format, but there are some *malformed messages* on the topic. 

Let's see a simple example. We'll put some data onto a new topic, using JSON but with some malformed messages

[source,bash]
----
docker run --interactive --rm --network ksql-troubleshooting_default \
    confluentinc/cp-kafkacat \
    kafkacat -b kafka:29092 \
            -t dummy_topic \
            -P <<EOF
{"col1":1,"col2":16000}
{"col1":2,"col2:42000}
{"col1":3,"col2":94000}
EOF
----

Note that the second message is invalid JSON, as it's missing a `"` after the field name (`col2`). 

Register the topic in KSQL: 

[source,sql]
----
ksql> CREATE STREAM DUMMY (COL1 INT, COL2 VARCHAR) \
        WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='dummy_topic', VALUE_FORMAT='JSON');

 Message
----------------
 Stream created
----------------
----

And now, remembering the lesson from above, set the offset to earliest so that we definitely will pull all the messages, and run a `SELECT`: 

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset'='earliest';
Successfully changed local property 'auto.offset.reset' from 'none' to 'earliest'
ksql> SELECT * FROM DUMMY;
1537186945005 | null | 1 | 16000
1537186945005 | null | 3 | 94000
----

Note that we only get *two* messages, even though there are *three* on the topic. 

If you check out the KSQL Server log you'll see

[source,bash]
----

// 
// * `-p 0` read from partition 0
// * `-o 1` start at offset 1, and `-c 1` consume just one message
// * `-f` to format the output and show some nice metadata

The output of this is: 

[source,bash]
----
Key:
Value: {"col1":2,"col2:42000}
Partition: 0    Offset: 1
--
----

And shows us, if we were in any doubt, that the message value is not valid JSON—and thus can't be consumed by KSQL. 

=== Locating KSQL Server logs

KSQL writes most of its logs to `stdout` by default. If you're https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-ksql-server/[running KSQL using Docker] then you'll find the output in the container logs themselves, for example: 

* `docker logs 483b1958efc4` 
* `docker-compose logs ksql-server`

Using the Confluent CLI you can run : 

* `confluent log ksql-server`

If you've installed Confluent Platform using rpm/deb then you should find the logs under `/var/log/confluent/`. 

== Where Next? 

So you're still stuck, and you need more help? There's several places to turn: 

* KSQL is supported as part of the Confluent Enterprise platform— https://www.confluent.io/contact/[contact us for details]
* Community support for KSQL is available: 
** http://cnfl.io/slack[Confluent Community Slack] #ksql channel
** https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues[Search for similar issues] on GitHub, or  https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues/new[raise a new issue] if one doesn't exist
