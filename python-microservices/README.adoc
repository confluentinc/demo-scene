# Random Pizza Generator
an event-driven microservices demo with Python and Kafka

## Description

This demo consists of the following projects:

  - *pizza-service* a Flask app with Kafka support.
  - *sauce-service* a basic Python app with Kafka.
  - *cheese-service* a basic Python app with Kafka.
  - *meat-service* a basic Python app with Kafka.
  - *veggie-service* a basic Python app with Kafka.


The demo was built using Confluent Cloud, the Cloud-native service for Apache Kafka. If you don't have an account on Confluent Cloud, you can set that up [here](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud).

## Running the demo

Before running this demo, you will need to update the `config.properties` file in each project. Replace the fields marked with `< >` using values from your Confluent Cloud cluster. Also, you will need to create 5 topics in Confluent Cloud. They can each have 1 partion (or more if you so desire): `pizza`, `pizza-with-sauce`, `pizza-with-cheese`, `pizza-with-meat`, and `pizza-with-veggies`. 

Once all five services are up and running, you can issue the following `curl` command to send an order for 3 random pizzas.
`curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/order/5`  

This will trigger a series of events which will result in a completed pizza order with the five pizzas, and it will return a UUID of that pizza order. Of course you can alter that last value in the URL to get a different number of pizzas.  (I was a bit hungry when I wrote this.)

To see your pizzas in all their hot, delicious glory, run the following `curl` command using the UUID returned from the first call.

curl http://localhost:5000/order/{{pizza-order-UUID}}


*When you are done working with this demo project, you can delete these topics to avoid additional charges.*
